    "**Standardization** of datasets is a common requirement for many machine learning estimators implemented in scikit-learn. If some features of our data have very different scales (for example, one feature is in the range $[0, 1]$ and another can potentially be any positive number), **some models** might consider the feature with larger numerical values to be more important. This can be a problem, as we want our model to be able to learn from all features equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization transform our data in such a way that its distribution will have a mean value $\\mu = 0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = 1$. We can achieve this by using the `StandardScaler` from the `sklearn` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common preprocessing step is **normalization**. In this case, the data is scaled to a fixed range, usually $[0, 1]$. The motivation to use this scaling method includes preserving zeros in sparse data. For example, when making predictions about the expected outcome of an anticancer therapy, the value of $0$ observed tumors in a patient is probably much more informative for the predictive model than any other number of observed tumors alone. We can scale data to a certain range by using the `MinMaxScaler` from the `sklearn` library.\n",
